# Create a New Branch (Version Control)

Each ticket you receive should result in a brand new git branch being created. The branch should be created off of the most up to date in-progress branch. 

Creating a new branch helps to ensure a few things
- Your changes will not interfere with changes that somebody else is making to another portion of the application
- Your feature, despite being assigned to you, is not guaranteed to become a part of the final product. This may be due to delays, or a reprioritization of necessary features. 
- It's much easier to focus on the changes needed for a feature when they're isolated into a single branch. It's also easier to debug.
