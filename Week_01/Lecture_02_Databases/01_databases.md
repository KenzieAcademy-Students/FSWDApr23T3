# MongoDB
- Document Storage
- NoSQL database
  - Not only SQL (Structured Query Language)
- Stores almost a raw JSON object as an individual document
- MongoDB is the equivalent to a scenario where your town would have one centralized record location. Your medical records, tax records, ID information, etc. would all be stored in the same single file in one place.

# SQL Databases
- Data is stored in tables consisting of rows and columns
- Individual tables are designated to only describe a piece of the information
- SQL Databases are the equivalent to the real world scenario involving keeping people's information. The downside to SQL databases is that if you want the full picture (i.e. all information about a single entity), you'll need to go to multiple places.
